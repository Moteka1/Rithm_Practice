// Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1,
// compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

// image is on leetcode site
// The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!

// you can only trap water if the elevation dips

// Example:
// Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1], array
// Output: 6

/**
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
 */
var trap = function(height) {

};
